.Custom resources

{project-short} creates the following custom resources (CRs):

* `Provider`:
** Created when you add a source or target provider
** Stores provider attributes in order to connect to and interact with the providers

* `Plan`:
** Created when you create a migration plan
** Contains a list of VMs that are migrated together with the same migration parameters
** Selects VMs to fit the available migration resources until all VMs are migrated

* `Mapping`: Created when you map source and target networks or source and target storage

* `Migration`:
** Created when you run a migration plan
** Aggregates the migration progress
+
If a virtual machine fails to migrate, you can run a new migration with the same migration plan. Only the virtual machines that have not migrated will be migrated.

.Services

{project-short} creates the following services:

* Provider Inventory:
** Connects to the source and target providers
** Maintains a local inventory for mappings and plans
** Separate provider inventory pods for each provider enable scalability

* Validation:
** Validates the suitability of a VM for migration to {virt} by applying rules
** Triggered by the Provider Inventory service whenever a VM configuration change is detected
** Stores the VM validation status
* User Interface:
** Enables you to manipulate the {project-short} CRs
** Indicates the state of the CRs
** Displays the progress of a migration
* Controller: Implements the logic to reconcile the CRs with the state defined by the user
+
For example, when you create a Plan, the controllers validate it and add a status label. If a Plan fails validation, its status is `Not ready` and the Plan cannot be used to perform a migration.

* Aggregates the status of related CRs to provide a holistic and consistent view of the state of a migration
