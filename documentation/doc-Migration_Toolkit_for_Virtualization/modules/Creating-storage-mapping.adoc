= Creating a storage mapping

You can create a storage mapping to map data stores to {virt} storage classes.

.Prerequisites

* The local and shared persistent storage must support VM migration.

.Procedure

. In the web console, navigate to *Mappings* -> *Storage*.
. Click *Create mapping*.
. Select a *Source provider* and a *Target provider*.
. Select a data store from the *Source datastores* list and a storage class from the *Target storage classes* list.
+
NOTE: If the storage does not support link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/{ocp-version}/storage/dynamic-provisioning.html[dynamic provisioning], the default settings, `Filesystem` volume mode and `ReadWriteOnce` access mode, are applied. `Filesystem` volume mode is slower than `Block` volume mode. `ReadWriteOnce` access mode does not allow live VM migration.

. Click *Add* to create additional storage mappings or to map multiple data stores to a single storage class.
. Click *Create*.
+
The mapping is displayed in the *Storage mappings* list.
