= {project-full} custom resources and services

{The} {project-first} creates the following custom resources (CRs) and services.

.Custom resources

* `Provider` CRs store the source and target provider attributes in order to connect to and interact with the providers.
* `Mapping` CRs map the networks and storage of the source and target environments.
* A `Plan` CR, also called a migration plan, contains a list of virtual VMs that are migrated together with the same migration parameters. The `Plan` CR selects VMs to fit the available migration resources until all VMs are migrated.
// +
// If a virtual machine fails to migrate, you can run a new migration with the same migration plan. Only the virtual machines that have not been migrated will be migrated.
* A `Migration` CR is created when you run a migration plan.

.Services

* The _Provider Inventory_ service connects to the source and target providers. It maintains a local inventory for mappings and plans. Each provider has its own `ProviderInventory` pod to ensure scalability.

* The _Validation_ service checks the suitability of a VM for migration by applying rules and stores the validation status. The Validation service is triggered by the Provider Inventory service whenever a VM configuration change is detected.

* The _User Interface_ service enables you to create and configure {project-short} CRs. It also displays the status of the CRs and the progress of a migration.

* The _Migration Controller_, _Virtual Machine Import Controller_, _Kubevirt Controller_, and _Containerized Data Import (CDI) Controller_ services implement the logic to reconcile the CRs with the state defined by the user. Controllers perform actions with CRs in response to user requests.

For example, when you create a migration plan, the Migration Controller validates the plan and adds a status label. If the plan fails validation, its status is `Not ready` and the plan cannot be used to perform a migration. If the plan passes validation, its status is `Ready` and it can be used to perform a migration. After the migration, the Migration Controller changes the plan status to `Completed`.
