= {project-full} workflows

This section describes the {project-full} and {virt} workflows for migrating virtual machines (VMs). These steps assume that you are performing the migration by using the {project-short} console but you can also perform these steps by using the CLI.

The power state of a source VM is maintained after migration.

NOTE: These diagrams are in progress.

The {project-short} workflow comprises the following steps:

. You create a source provider, a target provider, a network mapping and a storage mapping.
. You create a migration plan that refers to the following resources:
* Source provider
* Target provider
* Network mapping
* Storage mapping
* One or more VMs
. You run a migration plan. Each time you run a migration plan, the plan creates a `Migration` CR. If a migration is incomplete, you can run a migration plan multiple times until all VMs are migrated.
. For each VM in the migration plan, the _Migration Controller_ creates a `VirtualMachineImport` CR and monitors its status. When all VMs have been migrated, the Migration Controller sets the status of the migration plan to `Completed`.

.{virt} workflow

The {virt} workflow comprises the following steps:

. When you run a migration plan, the _Migration Controller_ creates a `VirtualMachineImport` CR for each source VM.
. The _Virtual Machine Import Controller_ validates the `VirtualMachineImport` CR and generates a `VirtualMachine` CR and a `VirtualMachineInstance` CR.
. The Virtual Machine Import Controller retrieves the VM configuration, including network, storage, and metadata, linked in the `VirtualMachineImport` CR.  
+
_For each VM disk:_

. The Virtual Machine Import Controller creates a `DataVolume` CR as a wrapper for the Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) and annotations.  
. The _Containerized Data Importer (CDI) Controller_ creates a PVC. The Persistent Volume (PV) is dynamically provisioned by the `StorageClass` provisioner.  
. The CDI Controller creates an `Importer` pod. The `Importer` pod connects to the source VM disk, by using the VDDK SDK, and streams the disk to the PV.
. After the VM disks are transferred, the Virtual Machine Import Controller creates a `Conversion` pod that runs `virt-v2v` with all the PVCs attached to it.
. When the VM is powered on, the KubeVirt Controller creates a `VirtualMachineInstance` that runs the `QEMU-KVM` process with the PVCs attached as VM disks.
