= Custom resources and services

{The} {project-first} is provided as an {ocp} Operator. It creates and manages the following custom resources (CRs) and services.

.Custom resources

* `Provider` CR: Stores attributes that enable {project-short} to connect to and interact with the source and target providers.
* `NetworkMapping` CR: Maps the networks of the source and target providers.
* `StorageMapping` CR: Maps the storage of the source and target providers.
* `Provisioner` CR: Stores the configuration of the storage provisioners, such as supported volume and access modes.
* `Plan` CR: Contains a list of VMs that are migrated together with the same migration parameters and associated network and storage mappings.
* `Migration` CR: Runs a migration plan.
+
Only one `Migration` CR per migration plan can run at a given time. You can create multiple `Migration` CRs for a single `Plan` CR.

.Services

* Provider Inventory service:
** Connects to the source and target providers
** Maintains a local inventory for mappings and plans
** Stores VM configurations

* User Interface service:
** Enables you to create and configure {project-short} CRs.
** Displays the status of the CRs and the progress of a migration

* Controller services:
** Perform actions with CRs in response to user requests.
** The Migration Controller service orchestrates migrations.
+
When you create a migration plan, the Migration Controller service validates the plan and adds a status label. If the plan fails validation, the plan status is `Not ready` and the plan cannot be used to perform a migration. If the plan passes validation, the plan status is `Ready` and it can be used to perform a migration. After a successful migration, the Migration Controller changes the plan status to `Completed`.

** The Virtual Machine Import Controller, Kubevirt Controller, and Containerized Data Import (CDI) Controller services handle most technical operations.
