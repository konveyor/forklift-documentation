= Creating a migration plan

You can create a migration plan by using the {project-short} web console.

A migration plan allows you to group virtual machines to be migrated together or with the same migration parameters, for example, a percentage of the members of a cluster or a complete application.

.Prerequisites

* If the target provider is not the {virt} cluster on which you installed {project-short}, you must add a target provider.
* If your source provider is VMware, the following additional prerequisites apply:
** You must create a VDDK image and add it to the `HyperConverged` custom resource.
** For warm migration, you must enable link:https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/1020128[changed block tracking (CBT)] on the VMs and on the VM disks.
** If you are migrating more than 10 VMs from an ESXi host, you must increase the NFC service memory of the host.

.Procedure

. In the web console, click *Migration plans* and then click *Create migration plan*.
. Complete the following fields:

* *Plan name*: Enter a migration plan name to display in the migration plan list.
* *Plan description*: Optional: Brief description of the migration plan.
* *Source provider*: Select a source provider.
* *Target provider*: Select a target provider.
* *Target namespace*: You can type to search for an existing target namespace or create a new namespace.
* You can change the migration transfer network for this plan by clicking *Select a different network*, selecting a network from the list, and clicking *Select*.
+
If you defined a migration transfer network for the {virt} provider and if the network is in the target namespace, that network is the default network for all migration plans. Otherwise, the `pod` network is used.

. Click *Next*.
. Select options to filter the list of source VMs and click *Next*.
. Select the VMs to migrate and then click *Next*.
. Select an existing network mapping or create a new network mapping.
+
To create a new network mapping:

* Select a target network for each source network.
* Optional: Select *Save mapping to use again* and enter a network mapping name.
. Click *Next*.
. Select an existing storage mapping or create a new storage mapping.
+
To create a new storage mapping:

* Select a target storage class for each VMware data store or {rhv-full} storage domain.
* Optional: Select *Save mapping to use again* and enter a storage mapping name.
. Click *Next*.
. Select a migration type and click *Next*.
* Cold migration: The source VMs are stopped while the data is copied.
* Warm migration: The source VMs run while the data is copied incrementally. Later, you will run the cutover, which stops the VMs and copies the remaining VM data and metadata. Warm migration is not supported for {rhv-full}.
. Click *Next*.
. Review your migration plan and click *Finish*.
+
The migration plan is saved in the migration plan list.

. Click the {kebab} of the migration plan and select *View details* to verify the migration plan details.
