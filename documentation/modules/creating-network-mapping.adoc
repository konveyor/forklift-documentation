= Creating a network mapping

You can create one or more network mappings by using the {project-short} web console to map source networks to {virt} networks.

[NOTE]
====
You cannot map an opaque network, typically managed by NSX, to {a-virt} network.
====

.Prerequisites

* Source and target providers added to the web console.
* If you map more than one source and target network, you must create a link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/{ocp-version}/virt/virtual_machines/vm_networking/virt-attaching-vm-multiple-networks.html#virt-creating-network-attachment-definition[network attachment definition] for each additional target network.

.Procedure

. Click *Mappings* -> *Network*.
. Click *Create mapping*.
. Complete the following fields:

* *Name*: Enter a name to display in the network mappings list.
* *Source provider*: Select a source provider.
* *Target provider*: Select a target provider.
* *Source networks*: Select a source network.
* *Target namespaces/networks*: Select a target network.

. Optional: Click *Add* to create additional network mappings or to map multiple source networks to a single target network.

. If you create an additional network mapping, select the network attachment definition as the target network.

. Click *Create*.

The network mapping is displayed on the *Network mappings* screen.
