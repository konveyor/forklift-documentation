.Network map remains in a NotReady state

If you are mapping more than one source and destination network and the network map remains in a `NotReady` state, the cause is a missing network attachment definition. You must create a link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/{ocp-version}/virt/virtual_machines/vm_networking/virt-attaching-vm-multiple-networks.html#virt-creating-network-attachment-definition[network attachment definition] for each additional destination network before you create the network map.
