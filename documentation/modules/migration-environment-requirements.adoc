= Migration environment requirements

Check your migration environment to ensure that the following requirements are met.

.VMware vSphere requirements

* The vSphere version must be 6.5 or later.
* link:https://www.vmware.com/support/ws5/doc/new_guest_tools_ws.html[VMware Tools] must be installed on all the VMs.
* If you are migrating more than 10 virtual machines (VMs) from an ESXi host in the same migration plan, you must increase the NFC service memory of the host.

.Virtual machine requirements

* ISO/CDROM disks must be unmounted.
* NICs must contain only one IPv4 and/or one IPv6 address.
* The virtual machine (VM) name must contain only lowercase letters (`a-z`), numbers (`0-9`), or hyphens (`-`), up to a maximum of 253 characters. The first and last characters must be alphanumeric. The name must not contain uppercase letters, spaces, periods (`.`), or special characters.
* The VM name must not duplicate the name of a VM in the {virt} environment.
* The operating system must be certified and supported link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/973163#ocpvirt[for use as a guest operating system with {virt}] _and_ link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/1351473[for conversion to KVM with `virt-v2v`].

.Network requirements

* IP addresses, VLANs, and other network configuration settings must not be changed before or after migration. The MAC addresses of the virtual machines are preserved during migration.
* The network connections between the source environment, the {virt} cluster, and the replication repository must be reliable and uninterrupted.
* If you are mapping multiple source and target networks, each additional {virt} network must have its own link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/{ocp-version}/virt/virtual_machines/vm_networking/virt-attaching-vm-multiple-networks.html#virt-creating-network-attachment-definition[network attachment definition].
* The firewalls must enable traffic over the following ports:
