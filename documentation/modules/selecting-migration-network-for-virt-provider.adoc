= Selecting a migration network for {a-virt} provider

You can select a default migration network for {a-virt} provider in the {project-short} web console to improve performance. The default migration network is used to transfer disks to the namespaces in which it is configured.

If you do not select a migration network, the default migration network is the `pod` network, which might not be optimal for disk transfer.

[NOTE]
====
You can override the default migration network of the provider by selecting a different network when you create a migration plan.

. Select a network from the list of available networks and click *Select*.
. Click the network number in the *Networks* column beside the provider to verify that the selected network is the default migration network.
